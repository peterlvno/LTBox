//! Cross-platform device-driver / udev-rule status + installer.
//!
//! Used by the GUI's startup driver-check banner + the Settings
//! "Install Drivers" action. Public surface stays the same regardless
//! of host OS so the GUI never has to branch by `cfg!(windows)`; the
//! platform impl picks how to interpret `Present` / `Missing` /
//! `NotWindows` for the local OS.
//!
//! ## Platform impl mapping
//!
//! | Host    | Module                  | Strategy |
//! |---------|-------------------------|----------|
//! | Windows | `driver::windows`       | Mode-aware `pnputil /enum-drivers` + DriverStore probe (`qcserlib.inf` for userspace / `qcwdfser.inf` for kernel); install by downloading the selected signed per-arch Qualcomm `.exe` and launching it via UAC (`Start-Process -Verb RunAs`). The installer self-elevates, so LTBox itself does not need to run as Administrator. |
//! | Linux   | `driver::linux`         | Userspace mode detects the LTBox udev rules at `/etc/udev/rules.d/51-ltbox-qcom.rules` and installs them through `pkexec … --install-udev`. Kernel mode probes the `qud` Debian package and installs the latest `qud_*_all.zip` release through `pkexec dpkg -i`. |
//! | macOS   | `driver::unsupported`   | No-op `NotWindows` — macOS is forced to userspace mode because Qualcomm publishes no macOS kernel driver and libusb claims the device directly. |
//!
//! The shared `DriverStatus` / `DriverError` / `Result` types live here so
//! the GUI never branches by `cfg`; the per-OS module decides which variants
//! it can produce.
